# Manager-of-Advertisements-Orchestrator
NOTE: Not every line of code in this project belongs to me. This code is similar to a group project I worked on at my last companyl.

This is the back end of the Manager of Advertisements project, to be paired with the Portal. This back end code deals with setting up database and tables, receiving requests from the front end for data, and returning said data when available.
